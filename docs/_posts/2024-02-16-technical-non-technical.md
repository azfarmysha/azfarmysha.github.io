title: "Developing a Technical Solution for a Non-Technical Business"
---

As a Product Owner of Samuk Weighing System Bangladesh (SWB), tasked with creating a multi-platform Desktop and Smartphone app for our non-technical industrial clients, I embarked on a transformative journey. Our goal was clear: revolutionize operations, meeting client’s needs and elevate customer experiences through the development of a tailored technical solution in a desktop and mobile app. Here's how I turned aspirations into reality, reshaping Samuk Weighing System’s business landscape in the process.

### Identifying the Opportunity
In the dynamic world of Samuk’s business of importing, supplying, manufacturing and assembling weighing machines, attention to detail is a necessity. Recognizing the inefficiencies of our manual weight tracking  system, I saw an opportunity to drive change. Our (then) outdated processes led to errors, delays, and missed opportunities. It was evident that a technical solution was needed to streamline operations and unlock growth potential.

### Understanding Business Dynamics
As the Product Owner responsible for our products at Samuk Weighing System Bangladesh, I took proactive steps to address our challenges, such as remodifying the old application into a more modernized hybrid desktop and smartphone app with the help of our UI/UX designer. I delved deeper into the intricacies of weighing system operations, where I got the opportunity to collaborate with stakeholders across departments. From understanding the nuances of importing, indenting, supplying, and manufacturing various scales, including digital truck weighbridge scales, to ensuring full guarantee and warranty coverage, this insight was pivotal in shaping our website and later, mobile app to cater to our client’s specific needs to make their daily work easy.

### Translating Vision into Action
By this time I had already studied the old application to pick out the sectors where I need to bring change, or, which needs some modification. With a clear understanding of our objectives, I worked closely with the designer team to translate our vision into tangible requirements. I made sure that the design serves our clients’ purpose in a simple but effective way. Together, we identified key functionalities essential for the success of the mobile app through the success of our clients.

### Ensuring Quality and Deployment
Quality assurance was central to our development process. Rigorous testing protocols were implemented to identify and address any issues before deployment. Our clients were very cooperative in this case. We sat through many scheduled meetings to make sure we understand their experience with using our mobile app and website. Once confident in our solution's stability, we orchestrated a seamless transition to production, minimizing disruption to our operations.

### Continuously Evolving
Launching our solution was just the beginning. Post-deployment, I remained committed to driving continuous improvement. Monitoring performance metrics and gathering user feedback allowed us to optimize our product. Regular updates ensured that our solution remained agile and aligned with our clients’ evolving needs.

### Conclusion
My journey as a Product Owner developing a technical solution for our non-technical business has been one of growth and innovation. By leveraging technology and fostering collaboration, we've transformed our operations, delivering value to both our business and customers. Looking ahead, I'm excited by the possibilities that lie ahead as we continue to innovate and evolve in a rapidly changing landscape.
